# Auto Provisioned LND setup

### Why?

lnd requires a wallet to be created and for the wallet to be unlocked in order to interact with the RPC server. This often requires users and/or admins to manually interact with their node via lncli. In a cloud infrastructure setting we rarely want manual steps. Especially non-codified provisioning steps. The following Dockerfile using <a href="https://github.com/lightninglabs/lndinit"> LND INIT </a> to auto-provision a lnd node.

### Example Build

`docker build -t lnd-testnet .`

### Example Run

`docker run -d --name lnd-testnet -v lndVolume:/root/.lnd -p 0.0.0.0:10009:10009 -p 0.0.0.0:9735:9735 lnd-testnet:latest testnet`

#### Notes

- Not meant for production use
- Have an external method to store seed phrase & pwd generated by lndinit
- Be sure to use a Docker volumes
